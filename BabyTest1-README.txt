This ZIP file contains three text files:

BabyTest1-README.txt        THIS FILE
BabyTest1-ASSEMBLER.txt     Baby program in assembly language
BabyTest1-MC.txt            Baby program in machine code

Your Baby simulator should be able to read the MC file into memory and run it. 
You may also like to write some other programs to test that other opcodes work.
It contains only ten 32-bit numbers - the Baby could handle up to 32 32-bit numbers.

If you read the ASSEMBLER file, you should be able to get an understanding of 
what the program does.

Note that VAR is NOT one of the Baby opcodes, it is a special assembler directive
to declare a variable using one of the memory locations.

START, END, NUM01, NUM02 and MYSUM are all user-declared labels which translate 
into addresses in the machine code.
